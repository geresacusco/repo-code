* In `r yearlabel`, the average (median) household in Scotland had Â£`r median` in personal wealth.

* Average wealth was lowest for the youngest households. Wealth generally grows throughout people's life courses up until pension age when it decreases again.

* Note that small differences in median wealth between different household types may not be meaningful and should be interpreted with care. This is because these estimates are based on a sample survey and could be slightly higher or lower if we interviewed a different sample of the population.
