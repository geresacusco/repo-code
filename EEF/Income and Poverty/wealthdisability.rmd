* In `r yearlabel`, the average (median) household in Scotland had Â£`r median` in personal wealth.

* Households with no disabled household members had slightly above average wealth, whereas those with disabled members had below average wealth.

* Note that small differences in median wealth between different household types may not be meaningful and should be interpreted with care. This is because these estimates are based on a sample survey and could be slightly higher or lower if we interviewed a different sample of the population.
