* Poverty rates remained higher for households with a disabled adult.Â 

* In `r graphLatest$yearlab[1]`, the poverty rate after housing costs for people in families with a disabled person was `r filter(graphLatest,grepl("with somebody disabled in the family",Breakdown),Measure=="% in relative poverty AHC")$Figure`%. This compares with `r filter(graphLatest,grepl("with nobody disabled in the family",Breakdown),Measure=="% in relative poverty AHC")$Figure`% of people in a family without a disabled person who were in poverty.
