* In Scotland, the self-employment rate for women (self-employed as a proportion of those in employment) was 8.1% in 2018 – lower than the self-employment rate for men at 16.0%, but 1.8 percentage points higher than in 2007.

* There are more self-employed men than self-employed women in all broad industrial sectors, with the exception of ‘Public Administration, Education and Health’ (in 2018, women made up 71% of the self-employed workforce in this sector) and ‘Other services’ (in 2018, women made up 52% of the self-employed workforce in this sector).  Around 45% of all self-employed women work in these two sectors alone – compared to around 13% of self-employed men. 

* In 2018, the self-employment rate for women was lower in Scotland (8.1%), than in the UK as a whole (10.6%). The UK figure is particularly influenced by comparatively high rates in London and the south of England.
