* In `r max(graphData$Year)`, a `r higher_lower(most_disc,least_disc)` proportion of adults living in the most deprived areas (`r round(most_disc)` per cent) experienced discrimination in the previous 12 months than adults living in the least deprived areas (`r round(least_disc)` per cent).

* A `r higher_lower(most_harr,least_harr)` proportion of adults living in the most deprived areas (`r round(most_harr)` per cent) had experienced harassment compared to adults living in the least deprived areas (`r round(least_harr)` per cent).
