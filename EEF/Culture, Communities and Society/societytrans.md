Information on public attitudes toward transgender people was collected in the 2015 Scottish Social Attitudes Survey.

* 39% of respondents said they would be unhappy about a family member forming a relationship with someone who cross-dresses in public.

* 32% said the same of someone who has undergone gender reassignment.

* The research found that context is important when understanding public attitudes. Whilst 32% of people would be unhappy with a family member forming a relationship with someone who has undergone gender reassignment, 20% felt someone who has undergone gender reassignment would be an unsuitable primary school teacher.
