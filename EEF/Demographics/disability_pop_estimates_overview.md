**In Scotland's 2011 Census:**

* 1,040,000 people had a long-term activity-limiting health problem or disability.

* The overall proportion of people in Scotland with a long-term activity-limiting health problem or disability was slightly lower in 2011 than in 2001 (19.6% compared to 20.3%). This is despite the fact that the number of people aged 65 and over increased by over 10%.

* More than four fifths of people aged 85 years and over reported that their day-to-day activities were limited by a long-term health problem or disability, compared to around 5% of children under the age of 16 years.

* As expected, people who disclosed that they were limited 'a lot' by a long-term health problem or disability were much more likely to rate their general health poorly.
