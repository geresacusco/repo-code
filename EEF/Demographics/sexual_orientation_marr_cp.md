* There were 27,525 marriages in Scotland in 2018, 915 (3%) fewer than in 2017. Of these, 979 were same-sex marriages (involving 399 male couples and 580 female couples).

* Before 2005, same-sex couples could not form legally recognised unions. In the first full year after civil partnerships were introduced, over 1,000 couples registered civil partnerships. This number then stabilised at around 500 a year until Scotland legalised same-sex marriage in December 2014.

* In 2015, over 1,600 same-sex couples married or changed their civil partnership to marriage. Since then, the number of same-sex marriages stabilised at just under 1,000 a year and the number of civil partnerships reduced to around 60 to 70 a year.
