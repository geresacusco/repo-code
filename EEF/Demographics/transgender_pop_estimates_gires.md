In 2009, GIRES published a report that was funded by the Home Office. 

* In 2007 on a UK level, the prevalence of people who had sought medical care for gender variance was 20 per 100,000, i.e. 10,000 people, of whom 6,000 had undergone transition. 80% were trans women (assigned as boys at birth) and 20% as trans men (assigned as girls at birth).

* Gender variant people present for treatment at any age. The median age is 42.

* GIRES estimated that between 0.6% and 1.0% of the population were trans (including trans people who hadn't sought medical care as of 2007)
