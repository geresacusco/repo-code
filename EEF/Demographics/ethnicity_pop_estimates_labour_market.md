Population information on Scotland's ethnic groups is also collected in the Annual Population Survey. The ethnicity question for Scotland was changed in the Labour Force Survey from April 2011 to bring it in line with the 2011 Scottish Census data collection.

* In 2016, the employment rate for ethnic minorities was 57.6% (down 1.3 percentage points from 58.9% in 2015) compared to an employment rate of 73.7% for ethnic white people (up 0.1 percentage points), an employment rate gap of 16.2 percentage points.

* Minority ethnic women had substantially lower employment rates in 2016 (45.0%) than white ethnic women (70.5%), whereas the employment rate for minority ethnic males (71.6%) was more similar to white ethnic males (77.1%).

* Looking at the minority ethnic and white ethnic employment rates in 2016 broken down by age, the employment rate for ethnic minorities aged 16-24 was 38 percentage points lower than the white ethnic group of the same age. This employment rate gap decreased with age with the oldest age group (50-64) having higher employment rates in the minority ethnic group than in the white ethnic group.
