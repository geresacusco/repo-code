* The current (mid-2018) population structure includes a sharp peak at around age 71 (post-war baby boomers), and a large bulge with people in their mid-50s (children of baby boomers). As these generations age, with higher life expectancy than in previous generations, they are projected to make up a growing proportion of the population.
