* On 31st July `r latestyear`, of the estimated `r Count_of_cp_latest` children who were on the child protection register 		in Scotland, `r CP_pc_male` per cent were male and `r CP_pc_female` per cent were female. The remaining `r 	CP_pc_pre_birth` per cent of children had an unknown gender due to them being placed on the child protection 	register prior to being	born.
