* In `r latestyear`, an estimated `r percent_lac_disabled` per cent of Scotland's `r Count_of_lac` looked after children were recorded as having a disability. This is `r higher_lower(percent_lac_disabled,all_children$Figure)` the overall proportion of children with a disability (`r round(all_children$Figure,0)` per cent) found in the [Scottish Health Survey `r all_children$Year[1]`](https://www2.gov.scot/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Health/scottish-health-survey)
