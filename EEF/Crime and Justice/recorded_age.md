* Whilst the specific age of the victim cannot generally be determined from the data supplied by Police Scotland, many of the sexual offence crime codes used by the Police to record crime make it clear when the victim was aged under 18 (for example, Sexual assault of older male child (13-15 years)). By adding up all those crime codes, we know that at least 39% of the 13,547 sexual offences recorded in 2018-19 by the police related to a victim under the age of 18.
