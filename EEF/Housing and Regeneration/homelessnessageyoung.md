-   Homelessness is biased towards younger age groups. For example, in
    2016/17 10% of main applicants assessed as homeless or potentially
    homeless were aged 16 to 19 years old. However only 1% of households
    in Scotland are headed by someone aged 16 to 19 years old.
    Similarly, 20 to 24 year olds make up 17% of cases assessed as
    homeless or potentially homeless, but only 4% of households are
    headed by someone in this age group.
