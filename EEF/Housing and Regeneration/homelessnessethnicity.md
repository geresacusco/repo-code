-   There were around 27,000 cases assessed as homeless during 2016/17,
    who were entitled to apply for assistance as a result of their UK or
    EU nationality. The ethnic composition of this group is broadly in
    line with that for the Scottish population as a whole. The
    proportion of white homeless is around 91% in the homelessness data
    compared with 96% for Scotland.
