* Households where the highest income householder (HIH) is aged 60 years or more, have had continuously higher rates of owner-occupation since 2009. Whilst the rates of owner-occupation for HIHâ€™ s aged 60 and over have remained relatively constant of late, the rates for the other age groups have been in decline, most notably for those aged 16-34. However since 2014 the rate amongst this group increased by six percentage points.
* Private rented households were more likely to contain a highest income householder aged 16 to 24 years or 25 to 34 years compared to other tenures. Households buying with a mortgage were more likely to contain a highest income householder aged 35 to 44 years or 45 to 59 years than other tenures; and households owned outright were more likely to contain a highest income householder aged 60 to 74 years or 75 years and over.
