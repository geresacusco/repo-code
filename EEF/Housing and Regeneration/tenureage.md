-   Households where the highest income householder (HIH) is aged 60
    years or more, have had continuously higher rates of
    owner-occupation since 2009. Whilst the rates of owner-occupation
    for HIHâ€™ s aged 60 and over have remained relatively constant of
    late, the rates for the other age groups have been in decline, most
    notably for those aged 16-34. However since 2014 the rate amongst
    this group increased by six percentage points.
