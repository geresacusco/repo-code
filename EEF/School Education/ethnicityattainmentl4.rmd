* In `r latestyear`, school leavers who identified their ethnicity as `r ethnic_name` had the highest levels of attainment with
	`r ethnic_fig` per cent of leavers achieving one or more passes at SCQF Level 4 or better, far higher than the percentage 
	for leavers with an ethnicity of White-Scottish (`r scottish_fig` per cent achieving this level).
