An online survey of Transgender people in the UK in April 2011 sought adults' points of view regarding children's experiences in school:
* Almost half of respondents (44 per cent) thought that the behaviour of other children presented the most challenges to gender variant children;
* Nearly two-thirds of respondents (47 per cent) thought that intervention, such as guidance or training, would be best focussed in secondary school;
* Nearly half of respondents (45 per cent) thought that teachers did not have the tools to tackle the bullying of gender variant children in schools.
