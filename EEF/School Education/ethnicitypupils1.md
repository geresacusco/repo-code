-   In 2018, 85 per cent of pupils were recorded as being white Scottish
    or white other British. The largest other ethnic backgrounds include
    White - Other (5 per cent), Asian â€“ Pakistani (2 per cent), and
    Unknown (2 per cent).

-   The number of White - Gypsy/Traveller pupils in 2018 had gone up by
    79 per cent from 737 in 2011 to 1,320 in 2018, although this could
    be due to improved recording.

-   The Pupil Census shows a higher proportion of ethnic minority pupils
    in schools than would be expected from the ethnic minority share of
    the population at large: this is mainly explained by the younger age
    profile of the ethnic minority population, and with this a higher
    proportion of households with dependent age children.
