`

* In `r latestyear_text`, `r round((scottish+other_brit)/total_pupils*100,0)` per cent of pupils were recorded as being 
	white Scottish or white other British. The largest other ethnic backgrounds include `r top1_name`
	(`r top1_fig` per cent), `r top2_name` (`r top2_fig` per cent), and `r top3_name` (`r top3_fig` per cent).

* The number of White - Gypsy/Traveller pupils in `r latestyear_text` had gone up by `r round((gypsy - gypsy_2011)/gypsy_2011 *100,0)` per cent from `r gypsy_2011` 
	in 2011 to `r format(round(gypsy,0), nsmall = 0, big.mark=",")` in `r latestyear_text`, although this could be due to improved recording.

* The Pupil Census shows a higher proportion of ethnic minority pupils in schools than would be expected from the ethnic minority share of the 
	population at large: this is mainly explained by the younger age profile of the ethnic minority population, and with this a higher proportion 
	of households with dependent age children.
