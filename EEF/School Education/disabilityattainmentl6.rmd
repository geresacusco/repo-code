* School leavers with additional support needs in `r latestyear`, continued to have lower attainment, with `r asn` per cent of pupils 
	with an additional support need achieving one or more passes at SCQF Level 6 or  better compared to `r noasn` per cent for 
	those with no additional support needs.
