* There is no significant difference in the proportion of respondents who identified as gay/lesbian/bisexual/other and the proportion of respondents who identified 
as heterosexual who visited the outdoors once a week or more. Due to the small number of individuals identifying as gay/lesbian/bisexual/other sexual orientation 
in the Scottish Household Survey, data for 2016 and 2017 were combined to reach an adequate sample size to test for a statistically significant difference.
