* The proportion of adults with a long-term limiting mental or physical health condition or disability is increasing, as the population ages

* Between `r prev_total$Year` and `r total$Year`, the proportion of women who were disabled `r increased_decreased(prev_women$Figure,women$Figure)` from `r round(prev_women$Figure)`% to `r round(women$Figure)`%

* Over the same period, the proportion of men who were disabled `r increased_decreased(prev_men$Figure,men$Figure)` from `r round(prev_men$Figure)`% to `r round(men$Figure)`%
