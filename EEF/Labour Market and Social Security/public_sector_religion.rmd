`r latest_year <- graphData$Year %>% max`
`r first_year <- graphData$Year %>% min`

*In `r latest_year` the Scottish Government workforce was made up of:*
  
* `r filter(graphData,Breakdown=="None",Year==latest_year)$Figure %>% sprintf("%1.1f%%",.)` belonged to no religion
* `r filter(graphData,Breakdown=="Christian",Year==latest_year)$Figure %>% sprintf("%1.1f%%",.)` were Christian
* `r filter(graphData,Breakdown=="Other Religion",Year==latest_year)$Figure %>% sprintf("%1.1f%%",.)` belonged to another religion
* For `r filter(graphData,Breakdown%in%c("Unknown","Prefer not to say"),Year==latest_year)$Figure %>% sum %>% sprintf("%1.1f%%",.)` it's not known which religion they belonged to. 
* Between `r first_year` and `r latest_year`, declaration rates have increased from `r (100-filter(graphData, Year==first_year, Breakdown == "Unknown")$Figure) %>% sprintf("%1.1f%%",.)` to `r (100-filter(graphData, Year==latest_year, Breakdown == "Unknown")$Figure) %>% sprintf("%1.1f%%",.)`
