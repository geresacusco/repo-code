`r latest_year <- graphData$Year %>% max`

*In `r latest_year` the Scottish Government workforce was made up of:*

* `r filter(graphData,Breakdown==age_bands[1],Year==latest_year)$Figure %>% sprintf("%1.1f%%",.)` aged `r age_bands[1]`
* `r filter(graphData,Breakdown==age_bands[2],Year==latest_year)$Figure %>% sprintf("%1.1f%%",.)` aged `r age_bands[2]`
* `r filter(graphData,Breakdown==age_bands[3],Year==latest_year)$Figure %>% sprintf("%1.1f%%",.)` aged `r age_bands[3]`
* `r filter(graphData,Breakdown==age_bands[4],Year==latest_year)$Figure %>% sprintf("%1.1f%%",.)` aged `r age_bands[4]`
* `r filter(graphData,Breakdown==age_bands[5],Year==latest_year)$Figure %>% sprintf("%1.1f%%",.)` aged `r age_bands[5]`

*Between `r first_year` and `r latest_year`:*

* Staff aged `r change$Breakdown[1]` increasingly comprise more of the organisations workforce: increasing from `r filter(graphData, Year==first_year, Breakdown == change$Breakdown[1])$Figure %>% sprintf("%1.1f%%",.)` to `r filter(graphData, Year==latest_year, Breakdown == change$Breakdown[1])$Figure %>% sprintf("%1.1f%%",.)`
* A decreasing proportion of the workforce were aged `r change$Breakdown[5]`: decreasing from `r filter(graphData, Year==first_year, Breakdown == change$Breakdown[5])$Figure %>% sprintf("%1.1f%%",.)` to `r filter(graphData, Year==latest_year, Breakdown == change$Breakdown[5])$Figure %>% sprintf("%1.1f%%",.)`
