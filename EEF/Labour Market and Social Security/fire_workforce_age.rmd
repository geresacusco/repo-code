* In `r latest_year`, the largest proportions of the Scottish Fire and rescue workforce were in the age bands `r latest_data$Breakdown[1]` (`r latest_data$Figure[1] %>% sprintf("%1.1f%%",.)`) and `r latest_data$Breakdown[2]` (`r latest_data$Figure[2] %>% sprintf("%1.1f%%",.)`).
* Fewer young people were in the workforce with `r filter(latest_data,Breakdown==age_bands[1])$Figure %>% sprintf("%1.1f%%",.)` aged `r age_bands[1]`.
