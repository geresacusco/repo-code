* The Scottish Cancer Patient Experience Survey is part of the Scottish Care Experience Survey Programme, a suite of national surveys asking about experiences of health services. The survey asks about people’s experience of their cancer care journey, from thinking that something might be wrong with them to the support they received after diagnosis and treatment. Variation in peoples’ experiences can be caused by a differences in local population characteristics, needs or geographical setting. Additional analysis of the survey results to examine the relationship between self-reported experience and a range of demographic and geographic characteristics has been undertaken. It should be noted that this analysis is not routinely carried out for every survey.
