* There was no significant difference between the WEMWBS mean scores for men and women in 2018 (49.3 and 49.6, respectively). Further, there was no significant change in the scores of men or women compared to last year (in 2017 the WEMWBS mean score was 49.9 for men and 49.7 for women).
* More men (55%) had GHQ-12 scores of zero, than women (50%) in 2018. This is typical of the pattern since 2003, where a consistently higher proportion of men than women had GHQ-12 scores of zero. Correspondingly, from 2003 to 2018, women were more likely than men to have a GHQ-12 score of 4 or more, however in 2018 this difference was not significant (21% among women and 18% among men).
