* Since 2003, the proportion of men drinking at hazardous or harmful levels has been at least twice that of women (32% and 16% respectively in 2018).
* Among women, prevalence of nondrinking rose from 13% in 2003 to 20% in 2013 and has remained stable since (18-19%). Among men non-drinking prevalence rose from 8% in 2003 to 14% in 2014 and has stabilised since (13-14%).
* In 2018, men were likely to consume more units per week on average than women (a mean of 16.1 units per week for men compared with 8.9 for women).
* The percentage of men drinking more than four units on their heaviest drinking day has declined significantly between 2003 (45%) and 2018 (36%). The percentage of women drinking more than three units on their heaviest drinking day also declined significantly between 2003 (37%) and 2018 (28%).
* In 2018, 23% of men consumed more than 8 units on their heaviest drinking day, significantly lower than the rate of 29% in 2003. For women, prevalence of consuming more than 6 units of alcohol on their heaviest drinking day was also significantly lower in 2018 (14%) than in 2003 (19%).
* As in previous survey years, in 2018, male drinkers drank on average more units than female drinkers on their heaviest drinking day (8.5 units for men compared with 5.7 units for women).
* In 2018, a higher proportion of men than women drank alcohol on more than 5 days in the last week (13% of men compared to 9% of women).  
* In 2018, male drinkers drank alcohol on more days per week on average than female drinkers (2.9 mean days for men compared to 2.5 mean days for women), again this is consistent with previous survey years.
