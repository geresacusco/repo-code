*Adults:*

* The percentage of adults who met the Chief Medical Officerâ€™s guidelines of 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity (MVPA) a week varies alongside the level of multiple deprivation in their area. In 2018, 75% of adults (16+ years old) living in the least deprived areas met MVPA guidelines, compared with adults living in the most deprived areas (55%).

* Similarly, only 12% of adults in the least deprived areas recorded less than 30 minutes of MVPA per week, compared with 32% in the most deprived areas. The contrast was stronger for men (least deprived 9%, most deprived 30% very low activity) than for women (least deprived 14%, most deprived 33%).

* Between 2012 and 2017, for men, the age standardised prevalence of adherence to the MVPA guidelines ranged from 77% in the least deprived areas to 63% in the most deprived areas in 2017. Among women, the age-standardised prevalence of adherence to the MVPA guidelines dropped from 67% (least deprived) to 51% (most deprived).

*Participation*

* In the least deprived areas, 90% of adults participated in physical activity and sport over a four-week period, compared to 69% in the most deprived areas. This includes 77% participating in recreational walking in the least deprived areas and 59% in the most deprived. When walking was excluded, 68% of adults in the least deprived areas participated compared with 41% in the most deprived.

*Children:*

* In 2016, children (aged 2-15) living in the least deprived areas were more likely to complete an average of at least 60 minutes of MVPA a day compared to children living in the most deprived areas (79% and 70% respectively).
