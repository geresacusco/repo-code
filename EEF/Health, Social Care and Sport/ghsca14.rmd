* Drug-related deaths have increased significantly in Scotland in recent years. Although men still account for the majority of cases, over the last 10 years the percentage increase in deaths among women has been much greater than among men.

The Scottish Government commissioned a scoping project examining potential explanations for the disproportionate rise in drug-related deaths among women. The following factors have been identified as potentially contributing to the disproportionate rise in drug-related deaths among women:

* Ageing among a cohort of women who use drugs, which may be more pronounced among women than men and which may act to increase the risk of drug-related deaths through a range of factors, whether individual (e.g., co-morbidities), clinical (e.g. polypharmacy), and social (e.g. bereavements, loss of maternal role). 
 
* Changes in patterns of substance use, particularly polysubstance use and potential increases in the problem use of specific prescription medications (whether prescribed directly or obtained illicitly). These changes might interact with the ageing phenomenon to further increase risk. 
 
* Increasing prevalence of physical and mental health problems, which appears to be more pronounced among women who use drugs than their male peers; this may be linked to the ageing phenomenon described above. 

* Changes in relationships and parenting roles, including social isolation and the potential cumulative impact of multiple child removals. 

* Ongoing risk among women engaged with drug treatment services, potentially reflecting failures to meet needs or missed opportunities. 

* Changes to treatment services, and wider health and social services, particularly cuts in funding resulting in withdrawal of services, reduced provision, under-staffing or under-skilled staffing, lack of continuity in relationships, or a change in ethos. 

* Unintended consequences of the policy and practice focus on recovery-oriented systems of care, which some stakeholders felt may have adversely affected harm reduction provision and efforts to address broader life circumstances.

* Changes in the welfare benefits system which may particularly impact on women, and which may interact with: vulnerability to abusive or coercive relationships, involvement in commercial sex work, previous or ongoing experiences of trauma, mental health issues, cuts to drug treatment services and other health and social care provision.

* Interaction between factors above and known barriers for women engaging with treatment services, which may be practical (such as caring responsibilities) or psychological/relational (such as stigma, coercion, and fear of losing custody of children). 

* Interaction between the factors described above and previous experiences of trauma and adversity, which affect vulnerability to new challenges, coping strategies, and access to and engagement with services.
