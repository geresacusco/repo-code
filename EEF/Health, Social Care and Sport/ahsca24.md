* The Health and Care Experience Survey is part of the Scottish Care Experience Survey Programme, a suite of national surveys asking about experiences of health services. The survey asks people about their experiences of accessing and using their local Primary Care services, including their GP Practice. Variation in peoplesâ€™ experiences can be caused by a differences in local population characteristics, needs or geographical setting. Additional analysis of the survey results to examine the relationship between self-reported experience and a range of demographic and geographic characteristics has been undertaken. It should be noted that this analysis is not routinely carried out for every survey.
